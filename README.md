## Nature and Purpose of the delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv Dataset


### Nature:

### The delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv dataset consists of data related to the solubility of various chemical compounds. The dataset includes both the solubility values and a set of molecular descriptors that characterize the chemical structure and properties of each compound.

### Purpose:

### The primary purpose of this dataset is to serve as a basis for building and evaluating predictive models that estimate the solubility of chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. Solubility is a critical property in fields such as pharmaceuticals, chemistry, and materials science, as it influences the behavior and efficacy of compounds.
